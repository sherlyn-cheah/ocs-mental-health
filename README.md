# Open Case Studies - Mental Health in Youth

This project is based on a case study "Open Case Studies: Mental Health of American Youth" Wright, Carrie and Ontiveros, Michael and Jager, Leah and Taub, Margaret and Hicks, Stephanie C. (2020). https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-youth-mental-health. Mental Health of American Youth.

Data is from the [US National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NSDUHDetailedTabs2018R2/NSDUHDetTabsSect11pe2018.htm)
